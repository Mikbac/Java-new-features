* Switch Expressions (Preview) - "Extend switch so it can be used as either a statement or an expression, and so that
  both forms can use either traditional case ... : labels (with fall through) or new case ... -> labels (with no fall
  through), with a further new statement for yielding a value from a switch
  expression." (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/325)

## Java 14 (non-LTS)

* Records (Preview) - "Records provide a compact syntax for declaring classes which are transparent holders for
  shallowly immutable data." (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/359)
* Text Blocks (Second Preview) - "A text block is a multi-line string literal that avoids the need for most escape
  sequences, automatically formats the string in a predictable way, and gives the developer control over the format when
  desired." (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/368)
* Switch Expressions (Standard) - "Extend switch so it can be used as either a statement or an expression, and so that
  both forms can use either traditional case ... : labels (with fall through) or new case ... -> labels (with no fall
  through), with a further new statement for yielding a value from a switch
  expression." (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/361)
* Pattern Matching for instanceof (Preview) - " Pattern matching allows common logic in a program, namely the
  conditional extraction of components from objects, to be expressed more concisely and
  safely." (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/305)

## Java 15 (non-LTS)

* Text Blocks - (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/378)
* Records (Second Preview) - "Records provide a compact syntax for declaring classes which are transparent holders for
  shallowly immutable data." (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/384)
* Sealed Classes (Preview) - "Sealed classes and interfaces restrict which other classes or interfaces may extend or
  implement them." (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/360)

## Java 16 (non-LTS)

TO-DO

## Java 17 (LTS)

* Pattern Matching for switch (Preview) - "Extending pattern matching to switch allows an expression to be tested
  against a number of patterns, each with a specific action, so that complex data-oriented queries can be expressed
  concisely and safely." (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/406)
* Sealed Classes - "Sealed classes and interfaces restrict which other classes or interfaces may extend or implement
  them (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/409)
