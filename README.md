#### Extended Support Until -> Not Available

* Switch Expressions (Preview) - "Extend switch so it can be used as either a statement or an expression, and so that
  both forms can use either traditional case ... : labels (with fall through) or new case ... -> labels (with no fall
  through), with a further new statement for yielding a value from a switch
  expression." (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/325)

#### Extended Support Until -> Not Available

* Switch Expressions (Second Preview) - "Extend switch so it can be used as either a statement or an expression, and so
  that both forms can use either traditional case ... : labels (with fall through) or new case ... -> labels (with no
  fall through), with a further new statement for yielding a value from a switch
  expression." (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/354)
* Text Blocks (Preview) - "A text block is a multi-line string literal that avoids the need for most escape sequences,
  automatically formats the string in a predictable way, and gives the developer control over format when
  desired." (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/355)

  shallowly immutable data." (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/359)
* Text Blocks (Second Preview) - "A text block is a multi-line string literal that avoids the need for most escape
  sequences, automatically formats the string in a predictable way, and gives the developer control over the format when
  desired." (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/368)
* Switch Expressions (Standard) - "Extend switch so it can be used as either a statement or an expression, and so that
  both forms can use either traditional case ... : labels (with fall through) or new case ... -> labels (with no fall
  through), with a further new statement for yielding a value from a switch
  expression." (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/361)
* Pattern Matching for instanceof (Preview) - "Pattern matching allows common logic in a program, namely the conditional
  extraction of components from objects, to be expressed more concisely and safely." (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/305)

* Pattern Matching for switch (Preview) - "Extending pattern matching to switch allows an expression to be tested
  against a number of patterns, each with a specific action, so that complex data-oriented queries can be expressed
  concisely and safely." (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/406)
